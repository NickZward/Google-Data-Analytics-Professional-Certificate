# Scenario:
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# About the company:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

There are two types of cyclists, those who purchase casual tickets and those who purchase annual memberships. The marketing team believes that maximizing the annual number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

# What did the data tell us:

As you can see in the chart below members and casual riders prefer to use the service more during the week opposed than to the weekends. Tuesday is the day the service gets used most by both members and casual riders.

The second chart shows that the electric bike gets used the most. The classical bike is also used a lot. The docked bike is barely used for whatever reason.

This graph shows that casual riders spent on average more time on the bikes than members do.
